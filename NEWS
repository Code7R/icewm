      Improved response to changes in Motif hint property which avoids resizing
        client when border toggles.
      Add pseudo state WinStateUnmapped
      Check only one menu entry for fullscreen or maximized. Fix minimize check.
      Several fixes for correct PagerShowPreview updates for #496. Fix desktop
        mini icon for fullscreen windows. Allow at most one of fullscreen or
        maximized. Allow at most one of rollup, minimized, hidden. Don't
        activate fullscreen window on startup when it is unmapped. Handle
        _NET_WM_STATE change requests via the frame wm functions.
      Add sticky, unsticky, borderless, bordered.
      More succinct.
      Typo
      Prefer to handle client message requests via actionPerformed for
        consistency. Make AllWorkspaces consistent with Sticky.

      Record and size resizes when fullscreen to saved size hints. Permit size
        hints width_inc and height_inc to be zero to disable maximization.
      Revert "Stop overpainting clock every second when not needed" Because it
        causes valgrind errors like: "Conditional jump or move depends on
        uninitialised value(s)". It also changes lines for which there is no
        justification to change them. This reverts commit
        54f8e02959e73f5a7fce7ab6a84a45943bd46a90.
