Release icewm-2.9.1 released 2021-12-02

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (14):
      When the keyboard layout changes due to external reasons and the taskbar
        has the keyboard applet, then reflect the new layout in the taskbar
        applet for issue #622. Make the keyboard applet display all of the
        output of `setxkbmap -query` in the tooltip for the applet. When the
        mouse is inside the keyboard applet, then post the tooltip.  Compress
        all the XMappingEvents to one single keyboard update event. Don't set
        the text on the taskbar collapse button when there is already a non-zero
        image for that button. Add leftToRight as an opposite of rightToLeft.
      Update potfiles.
      Fix workspace pane sizing for right-to-left locales.
      Fix taskbar collapse button for right-to-left locales.

        display.

        support a wider range of characters, which improves support for
        languages with non-Latin scripts.
      Swap the columns in the about dialog for right-to-left locales.
      Fix the scaling of the taskbar background gradient for double height
        taskbar.

      Move FONT macros to header fontmacro.h.

      Print the codeset.
      Detect UTF-8 locale and support multibyte to wide character conversions.
      Support right-to-left languages for corefonts when i18n is enabled. When
        codesets are missing in a fontset, then only search for extra fonts in
        the same font family, and only when i18n is enabled.
