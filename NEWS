      We no longer need ypixbuf.cc ypixbuf.h yimage.cc.
      No longer include ypixbuf.h.
      Remove globals.
      initialize prop before using it.
      Rewrite icewmbg to support unique colors and images per workspace.
        Backgrounds are periodically checked for changes on filesystem when
        switching workspace. New option for one large full multi-head monitor
        background. Can now also scale an image to fully cover a single monitor.
        Suppors all configuration options also from the command line.
      Remove the ifdef CONFIG_GUIEVENTS around "extern YWMApp* wmapp", so that
        it is always available.
      Add some ifdefs/ifndefs to support different configure --enable/--disable
        option combinations.
      Changes for ALTLinux which has its own prototypes for strlcpy/strlcat.
        Also cleanup obsolete AC_FUNC_*s and sort -u the CHECK_FUNCs. Add two
        AC_RUN_IFELSE to detect correct operations of strlcpy/strcat. Define
        HAVE_STRLCPY / HAVE_STRLCAT if they do. Don't include our own
        strlcpy/strlcat if these are defined.
      Better fix for HAVE_STRLCPY/HAVE_STRLCAT.
      Also mention HAVE_STRLCPY and HAVE_STRLCAT. Remove obsolete and duplicate
        defines. Define defines always with a true numeric value of 1.
      Prefer AC_DEFINE/AH_TEMPLATE over AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED. This gives an #undef
        instead of a #define to 0, which is what we want.
      Manual pages in AsciiDoc.
      Generate manpages and html files from AsciiDoc.
      ASCIIMAN and ASCIIMAN_FORMAT variables for generating manpages from

        option to not start icewmtray. See issue
        https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/154.
      Make icewm-session much smaller in size by not linking any X11, image or
        font library. ylibrary.cc and ylibrary.h are obsolete. Reduce

      Docked iterator simplifies 8 loops.
      When ledPixSpace is 1 pixel wide then replicate it 5 times per space.
      Use tlog for MSG reports.
      Start icesound before icewm so it can catch the geStartup event.
      Let tlog also report milliseconds.
      When signalling GUI events: The first event must be geStartup, Ignore all
        other events before that. Because there is no event buffering, when
        multiple events occur in a burst, only signal the first event of the
        burst. See issue #159.
      Also support geDialogClosed and geDialogOpened GUI events. Don't generate
        a geWindowLower GUI event when the window is minimized, otherwise
        geWindowMin will be overwritten and missed by icesound. See issue #159.
      Also support geDialogClosed and geDialogOpened GUI events.
      If sound could not be played then don't ignore next event. Add -z ad -l
        options. Support geDialogOpened and geDialogClosed. Report which audio
        interface is used if verbose.
      Update for -z, -l.
      Better explain how to add a toolbar button. See issue #163.

      Remove include "config.h" from yarray.h (must be included in .cc).
      Remove Atoms which are: not used and defined in X11/Xatom.h.
      Remove unused occupyMenu and maximizeMenu.
      Remove unused _XA_WM_CLIENT_MACHINE and _XA_NET_WM_OPACITY.
      LogoutCommand should not affect the menu entries for Shutdown and Reboot.

      When including both yarray.h and mstring.h then include mstring before
        yarray.
      Memory leak fix and improvements for YRefArray. Derive YStringArray from
        YArray instead of YBaseArray. Add new class MStringArray for efficient
        array for mstrings.
      New tests for MStringArray and YRefArray. Add class stringcounted.
      Fix compilation for g++-4.8 for issue #152.
      include math.h because it uses round(3).
      Replace fmax/fmin by max/min as this is all integers, not FP.

        superfluous tray relayouts a little bit.
      keep expiry timer running (if nonempty).
      add type symmetry for mstring plus operator.
      Add some convenient options and a much more detailed help message.
      Fix a memory leak. Add support for showing workspace names also when
        PagerShowPreview is on.
      Make pagerShowNumbers default false so that workspace names are shown in
        PagerShowPreview mode.

      XDG base dir spec: "If, when attempting to write a file, the destination
        directory is non-existant an attempt should be made to create it with

      add TOC. fix email
      Split readDesktopNames in smaller functions and also limit count by
        workspaceCount. Only set _WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES if GNOME1_HINTS. Only set
        _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES if WMSPEC_HINTS. Fix for setting _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES
        where XmbTextListToTextProperty always failed for style
        XUTF8StringStyle.
      Create ~/.icewm/ with mode 0755.
      Incorporate two remarks: 1. Use a smart pointer to reduce boilerplate in
        readDesktopNames. 2. Restore XmbTextListToTextProperty in
        setNetDesktopNames, but now use a better return code checking, to fix
        the setting of _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES.
      fix a memory leak for YRect in updateLayout.
      Prevent creating a hole with undefined data if array insert is beyond the

      Revert erroneous commit d3b00cc4ed07f4f55695b9b91b20e0e9b08d9cf7 "JDK7
        focus fix" as this makes IceWM focus behavior non-conformant. See issue
        #23.
      Correction for seconds interval not being milliseconds.
      Taskbar never needs focus and should never get focus as focus must reside
        with applications. See issue #23.
      Inheritance from YAction is not needed.
      remove 2 unused actions.
      no need to activate the taskbar.
      avoid RevertToNone when setting focus. use RevertToPointerRoot.
      Turn predefined actions into an enumerated type. This allows to
        switch-case on them and saves a little space.
      workspaces Shift + left button click
      should have class
      Prevent disturbing flashing when switching focus.
      use CopyFromParent by default as this prevents disturbing flashing on
        frame borders when switching focus.
      prevent disturbing flashing on miniicons
      prefer CopyFromParent if possible.
      Better initialization of YDesktop window.
      When printing X errors use tlog instead of warn so we get the time in ms.
      Don't layout resize indicators when window is fullscreen, because then
        window widths/heights will be zero, which causes X errors.
      When an unmap event is due to a destroy and we have the DestroyNotify then
        set the wfDestroyed flag. This will prevent some operations which are
        invalid for destroyed windows and only cause X errors.
      SaveSet only applies to adopted clients, not to icewm internal windows.
        Only call XRemoveFromSaveSet and XAddToSaveSet if the frame is adopted.
        This saves needless operations which only result in X errors. When a
        window is destroyed then prevent it from being focused. Check the return
        value of XGetWindowAttributes as this may fail if window was destroyed.
        Fix a swapped parameter order for XSelectInput.
      Don't attempt to resize destroyed windows as this is needless and only
        causes X errors.
      It has no use to call setColormap when XColormapEvent is a
        ColormapUninstalled, but it can lead to X errors.
      Ignore stray closing form tags. Increase margins. Support WM protocols.
      Change ToolTipDelay from 1000 to 500. (1000 is really tedious).
      Two convenience functions for easier starting/disabling timers.
      Split class YToolTip into a timer and a window. Only create the window
        when needed. This saves about 25% of windows created (depends on theme).
      Only set tooltip text once, not twice.
      add CONFIG_RENDER to print_configured.
      Set tooltips on taskbar collapse button.
      prevent a SEGV crash in announceWorkArea when restarting from a nonzero
        workspace.
      add titles to taskbar for helpful "xwininfo -tree" output.
      convert from YCursor to Cursor.
      Only create titlebar buttons and resize pointer windows when it is
        apparent that they are really required. This prevents superfluous
        internal windows which were never used. Move titlebar buttons from
        wmframe.cc to wmtitle.cc. Improve sensitivity of resize handles at top
        side of title bar. Only create MiniIcon when it is going to be needed.
      option -j#JOBS
      add support for _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS.
      Move brittle inline frame list manipulations into robust dedicated list
        class.
      prevent illegal window layer.
      fix call to dumpZorder for 2nd arg.

      support _NET_WM_PING.
      corrections for _PING.
      perf _NET_CLIENT_LIST is done: only update on stacking changes.
      flags and style can be unsigned.
      Keep track of frame extents and only update if changed.
      Keep track of WM_STATE and WIN_STATE property values and only update them
        when they have changed.
      also track WM_STATE details.
      TrayApps were not freed when restarting, causing ylist preconditions to
        fail. Replacing inline list with YObjectArray corrects that and gets rid
        of list boilerplate. Use of a smart private timer simplifies timer
        management.
      track 3 more properties.
      Slightly more accurate use of fSavedWinState in setWinStateHint reduces
        superfluous property updates a bit more.
      Set background for tray icons in issue #188.
      _NET_WM_PING timeout also looks fir PID/HOST in group leader.
      Revert "Set background for tray icons in issue #188."
      Set taskbar background. This then also becomes a default background for
        tray icons in issue #188 while not hindering background pixmaps.
      add last missing applet titles.
      Make icewm tray internal by default. This is much more reliable (and
        cheaper) than an external icewmtray process.
      Weed out obsolete ifdefs and configure options.
      Add option TaskBarEnableSystemTray.  Fix internal/external YXTray
        parameter.
      Fix 3 bugs in YVec.
      Fix off by one bug for quickSwitchToAllWorkspaces. Reset fActiveWindow.
        Use only valid array index parameters. Fix a SIGFP crash on modulo with
        size 0. Make all switch window data local non-static. Refactor large
        functions. Cancel or repaint switch window when a frame is destroyed.
      Improvements to Switcher for when frames unexpectedly disappear. Also
        close down the Switcher when there are no more windows.
      Don't assume that a titlebar is always available in issue #195.
      NOTE, INFO, CARP to report info about code problems if DEBUG or PRECON is
        defined.

      On shutdown close any stray remaining windows in ~YDesktop.
      prefer using over typedef if possible.
      Update winoptions to reflect current code for issue #197. Plus more
        updates.
      Replace ObjectContainer with ObjectMenu for 3rd parameter of addContainer
        to avoid downcast to multi-inheriting subclass.
      add frame option foIgnorePagerPreview. remove unused sizeByMouse and
        fWinStateMask.
      Simplify WindowOptions handling and remove obsolete code. Add support for
        parsing new "ignorePagerPreview" frame option. Use binary search  to
        speedup winoption lookup. Check input values for validity. Only allocate
        WindowOptions when required.
      Update workspace buttons on screen changes when PagerShowPreview is on for
        issue #189. Remove superfluous calls to taskBar->updateLocation(),
        because this is already called by taskBar->relayoutNow().
      Update winoptions for ignorePagerPreview and document the hitherto
        undocumented default winoption value for all windows. Fix garbled
        display of font names. Add more formatting.

      hide first, then focusLastWindow
      typo
      focusLastWindow must not attempt to set focus to taskbar or nothing will
        have focus and a focusless system results without any keyboard control.
        This can be tested by using the AddressBar and then hit Escape. See
        issue #186.
      getLastFocus must not return taskBar, because taskBar never was focused
        and trying to give it focus results in other usable apps not getting
        focus, with an unfocused system in sloppy mode. In setFocus make sure
        that always focus has been set to something, otherwise we get the
        situation none of the global hotkeys work. This solves both issues #185
        and #186.
